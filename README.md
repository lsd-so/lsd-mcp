# LSD MCP server

We treated Claude to psychedelic therapy on LSD and now it can just do things.

## Quickstart

### Dependencies

To run MCP server, you'll need both [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed. To use the MCP server, you'll need to download either the [Claude desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) or [another MCP client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

### Giving Claude LSD



## What is MCP?

MCP, short for [model context protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), provides a communication layer between [Claude](https://claude.ai) and computer-accessible interfaces such as [the filesystem](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) or [web APIs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/slack). If a limiting factor of LLMs was its detachment from the "real world" since it's just a text generating model, MCP allows users and developers to bring Claude to life.

## What is LSD?

LSD, a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for the web, enables developers to connect the internet to your applications as though it were a [postgres compatible database](https://lsd.so/docs/database/postgres). Rather than present [a new semantic web ontology](https://xkcd.com/927/) or [make a new internet](https://urbit.org/), LSD SQL provides a dynamic declarative language that sits atop the existing one.

Designed to target browsers instead of [an architecture](https://llvm.org/), LSD allows for [powerful parallelization](https://lsd.so/docs/database/language/keywords/dive#example) while preserving simplicity with just-in-time tables meaning you can just get data without running a CREATE TABLE beforehand.

## Capabilities

From a high level, Claude can see, interact, and communicate with the web like a human. Here's an example of Claude writing LSD SQL to make an order on OpenTable.
